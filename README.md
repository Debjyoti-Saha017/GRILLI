# GRILLI
Welcome to offical repository for the app landing page. This project is designed  for a restaurant to showcase its menu, location, and services. The website includes a clean and user-friendly design, making it easy for customers to explore different dishes, check opening hours, and make reservations .I focused on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure smooth navigation and a visually appealing layout. The website also features an online booking system and a contact form for customer inquiries.This project helped me improve my web development skills and gain hands-on experience in designing a functional and interactive website.
